## <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iref.2024.04.017">Published in International Review of Economics & Finance</a>

### Brief description
- This study investigates the sectoral expected uncertainty connectedness in emerging markets across different frequencies and quantiles using the novel quantile timeâ€“frequency connectedness approach.
- We also conduct different portfolio analyses illustrating the importance of risk diversification to reduce investment uncertainty.
- This has important implications for international investors and policymakers in forming optimal investment portfolios reducing adverse risk spillovers.
- Published in International Review of Economics & Finance (an **A-ranked** journal)

### Technical skills used in this project
- Retrieved the daily price indices of 10 key global sectors from **Refinitiv Workspace**
- Wrote the manuscript using **LaTeX**
- Utilized **R Studio** to estimate sectoral uncertainty, to analyze the sectoral quantile time-frequency connectedness, to 
plot figures of quantile spillover effects, and to perform portfolio analysis as follows.
